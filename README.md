# ⚡ Energy Internet: A Data-Driven Exploration

This repository contains data visualizations and comparative insights into various performance and economic metrics of the **Energy Internet** — a next-generation concept integrating the traditional power grid with smart ICT systems, distributed energy resources, and decentralized control.

## 📊 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to analyze the **impact, performance, and practicality of Energy Internet implementations** across various dimensions such as:

- Voltage stability under renewable integration  
- Network loss reduction  
- Transaction latency in decentralized energy trading  
- Fault recovery performance  
- Lifecycle cost-benefit comparison

These analyses are supported by data extracted and synthesized from reputable peer-reviewed publications and real-world case studies.

## 📐 Data Handling & Methodology
All numerical data used in graphs was standardized using equal recurrence intervals to ensure statistical balance.

Outliers were smoothed to maintain a consistent maximum value across comparisons.

Visuals were created using Python (Matplotlib / Seaborn) and exported to high-quality vector images.
